In our everyday life we compare two objects in order to understand whether and how similar the two objects are. A formal way to measure that is similarity function. 

A similarity join is a way to find all pairs of objects whose similarities are no less than a given threshold using similarity function in relational database management systems.

First I will introduce similarity joins, in order to give good understanding of the article I survey, in the introduction I will explain:
What is similarity?
What are similarity joins ? 
How are similarity joins computed? 
What capabilities they allow?
What are the difficulties arising in this data era?

Then I will review two groundbreaking:
- how similarity joins can be computed efficiently on strings and sets.
- how to compute semantic similarity on strings and what sort of new capabilities it brings to relational database management systems.
